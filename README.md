Website:  My Winter Break

1-

The website is about my winter break. I wanted to do this because I felt that this semester, I really wanted to look at the positives in things. I wanted to start tracking my images and start time logging things in the past to look at. Since I know what I did over winter break and the pictures I took from them, I think this would be a good start. 

The website is going to have a home page explaining that this is my winter break blog website, a contact page so people can get in contact with me, a page explaining what I did back home and two other pages that are where I traveled to. In each of the pages there will be many different aspects of what I did and I am excited to display.

2- Site map in documentation folder

3- Wireframes and Reference Photos in documentation folder

4- Done

5- Contrast in colors + text can be seen

6- I used a more monochromatic color scheme of blue and just changed the hues and shades because I felt that my images had a lot of vibrant colors and the blue and white would add a calm feeling.
Having a monochromatic theme is also good at doing so as it doesn't create too much contrast with the information I am trying to convey in my images as well.
